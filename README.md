NOTES from Santosh:
  * BUG: multiple loading indictors for child comments on expansion
  * TODO: truncate comment length showing in comment card (tried a couple ways, but it didn't work from CSS)
  * TODO: dialog forms validation (no error checking at the moment)
  * TODO: show errors on dialog box (instead of window.alert)
  * TODO: unit tests (didn't have enough time)
  * TODO: redux (state seemed simple enough, but definitely needed some state management)
  * TODO: pagination (would need server side support)
